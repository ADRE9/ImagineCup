> We covered how to identify problems, and what questions we need to ask ourselves when developing a solid project idea and pitch. Now that youâ€™ve figured WHAT you want to Build and WHY itâ€™s a problem youâ€™d like to solve, itâ€™s time to think about WHO this project helps. Thatâ€™s right- it's time to talk to potential customers!

## Summary

Great job- you've chatted with potential customers, and have made efforts to better understand and empathize with your users. Next we'll refine out elevator pitch, and create a team vision statement.
