# Introduction

> This lesson is brought to by the Microsoft Garage. The Garage is a program that drives a culture of innovation at Microsoft. The Microsoft Garage delivers programs and experiences to Microsoft employees, customers, and partners that drive collaboration, creativity, and experimentation. The motto “doers, not talkers” continues to be the core of what the Garage is. The Garage attracts people who are passionate about making a difference in the world. They are relentlessly curious and lifelong, hands-on learners. By actively participating in the creative process, regardless of success or failure, each person gets the opportunity to gain valuable insights, increase their knowledge, and learn diverse perspectives.

In the early days of The Garage, the focus was on employees and mobilizing Microsoft’s cultural ambitions. The Garage helped employees integrate these cultural priorities — Growth Mindset, Customer Obsession, Diversity & Inclusion, One Microsoft, and Making a difference — into everyday work. As The Garage grew and the culture shift actions gained critical mass, entire teams and organizations began driving their business forward using these actions. An additional focus of The Garage was helping teams and organizations integrate growth mindset activities into team workflows. More recently, The Garage has continued to evolve by bringing in Microsoft customers to team up with employees for high speed growth mindset activities. 

The content in this lesson comes from the Garage Growth Framework. The Garage Growth Framework (GGF) is a set of online courses that shares methods applied in The Garage for hackers everywhere to build skills to take back to their day job before, during, and after a hackathon event, like the Microsoft Global Hackathon. The GGF methods are rooted in what we have learned working with teams at Microsoft, what we have discovered working with innovation leaders at other organizations, and what we have translated from the best practices of others.  

The Garage also hires interns! Learn more about one Garage intern’s experience by reading about it on the [Garage blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/blog/2017/09/12-weeks-microsoft-garage/).
