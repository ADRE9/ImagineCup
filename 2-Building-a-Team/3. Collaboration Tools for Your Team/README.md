### What is Microsoft Teams?
As stated on the [Microsoft Website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/welcome-to-microsoft-teams-b98d533f-118e-4bae-bf44-3df2470c2b12), Microsoft Teams is a collaboration app that helps your team stay organized and have conversations—all in one place. 

In Teams, the possibilities are endless. But you have 4 primary options when it comes to using Teams to work with others. You can Chat, Meet, Call, and Collaborate. Chatting enables you to Share your opinion and have fun with your team. Send GIFs, stickers, and emojis in a group chat or in one-to-one messages. Then you can meet. You can instantly go from group chat to video conference with the touch of a button. Teams of two or 10,000 can meet in one place from anywhere. On top of that, you can make and receive calls directly in Microsoft Teams with advanced features like group calling, cloud voicemail, and call transfers. And lastly, you can Collaborate by easily finding, sharing, and editing files in real time using familiar apps like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel right in Microsoft Teams.
