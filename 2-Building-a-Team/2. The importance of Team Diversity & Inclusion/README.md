## Topic 1: Your Team & Your 'Wave'



## Topic 2: Diving Deeper with Waves


## Topic 3: Recruiting Your Team



## Summary
As part of this lesson, you’ve learned the following: 

 - A wave is an event or trends at a unique point in time. A big idea
   starts with recognizing a wave - look for waves in your community.
 - Find people with diverse skills to ride the wave with you. The first
   step is recruiting people—with a diverse skill set—who have the
   confidence, desire, and ability to do the work.
 - When the people "fit" the project, team building happens over time.
   Build them into a team by introducing types of activities to enhance
   relations and define roles.
 - Build the people you have recruited into a team by encouraging open
   mindedness, describing member roles, establishing how decisions are
   made, and creating avenues for collaboration.
