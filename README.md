# Imagine Cup Training

This training content is aimed at students who will participate in the [Imagine Cup Competition](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/en-us/Events), or any other Hackathon-type competition. 

Cloud Advocates at Microsoft have come together to develop this training, and they are excited to share it with you!

**Thank You to Our Authors:** Chloe Condon, Pablo Veramendi, Jen Looper, Sarah Guthals, Ryan Mendenhall, and Chris Noring. 

# Getting Started

> **Students**, to use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo  complete the exercises on your own, starting with a pre-lecture quiz, then reading the lecture  completing the rest of the activities. Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends  go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/qprpajyoy3x0g7?WT.mc_id=academic-40229-cxa).
